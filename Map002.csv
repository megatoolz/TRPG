"\n<Adventurer B>If there's that many people, doesn't that mean there 
are less opportunities?","","","",""
"\n<Adventurer A>Not necessarily.
Apparently, no one has found the innermost depths of the ruins

be workin' overtime! Uhehehehe.","","","",""
"\n<Adventurer B>This can't be happening... we're so close to town too... ","","","",""

small fry like you!?","","","",""
