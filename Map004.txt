Original Text;Adventurer's Guild;EV001;EV002;EV003;EV004;EV005;EV006;EV007;EV008;\n<Guild Receptionist>If you're looking for Ms. Irina, 
she's in her office to your left.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Ah, I see you received a permit. Congratulations!;\n<Guild Receptionist>Ah! Makina, Ms. Irina is calling for you.;\n<Makina>She is? Alright, thanks.;\n<Guild Receptionist>I'm not sure if it's important, but please be careful 
in there, she's been quite upset since returning from 
the ruins.;\n<Makina>Haha, it's probably because of what happened... ;\n<Guild Receptionist>Please do your best like you always do.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Let's do our best tomorrow!;\n<Guild Receptionist>It's finally time.
Let's take this city back from Dalton!;\n<Guild Receptionist>Thank you for your hard work, Makina. 
The city should be a little safer now.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Makina. Have you seen any dwarves in the ruins?;\n<Makina>Yeah, I've seen them. 
Though they seem to not want anything to do with humans.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Dwarves tend to be unsociable towards outsiders.;\n<Makina>Did you need something from them?;\n<Guild Receptionist>Well you see, incidents involving
adventurers and dwarves have been on the rise recently.
Some dwarves whose homes were damaged are upset,
and are attacking adventurers.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Thankfully there haven't been any
casualties yet, but if this continues, it could turn
into a more serious conflict.;\n<Makina>Wow, I had no idea this was happening... ;\n<Guild Receptionist>So what do you think, Makina? 
Could you help me out with this problem?;\n<Makina>I'd be happy to help if there's compensation.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Unfortunately, due to the Dalton case,
all of the Guild's funds are tied up, so we don't
have anything to pay you with.;\n<Makina>Hmm, if that's the case, then I'm not really interested.;\n<Guild Receptionist>I see... ;\n<Celia>Then allow me to do something about it!;\n<Makina>Celia.;\n<Celia>If Makina doesn't want to do it, then I'll go in her stead.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Really!?;\n<Celia>Of course. What would you like me to 
do about the dwarves in question?;\n<Guild Receptionist>I would be quite thankful if you could
find a way to settle this peacefully.;\n<Celia>Understood. I'll see what I can do.;\n<Makina>Are you sure about this, Celia?;\n<Celia>Of course, just leave it to me.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Then I'll leave the dwarf matter in your hands, Celia.;\n<Celia>Very well, then I shall depart immediately.;\n<Makina>I wonder if it's okay to leave something like that 
up to Celia.;Would you like to watch Celia's event? 
(The scene will appear in your recollections regardless);Yes;No;\n<Guild Receptionist>Thanks to Celia, the dwarves have
stopped being a problem. And now I can stop worrying
about the other adventurers.;EV009;\n<Guild Staff>Hahh, no matter how much I do, the work just never ends.
I really want to hit up that massage place I've heard 
rumors of. But I just can't figure out where it is, 
even though it has a good rep.;\n<Guild Staff>Huh? The massage parlor is in the underground market? 
Oh, I wanted to go, but it's probably good that I didn't.;EV010;\n<Guild Staff>Hmmm, in the end, we still don't know what the ruins were 
built for. Even the reports from the adventurers aren't 
giving me a clear picture.;\n<Guild Staff>So Allos finally got fired, huh? 
He wasn't bad to work with, but he was too incompetent.;\n<Guild Staff>I wonder what he's going to do from here on.;\n<Guild Staff>I wonder what Allos is up to now... ;EV011;\n<Guild Adventurer>I saw some bandits in the ruins earlier.
I got away before they noticed me, 
but things are getting dangerous.;\n<Guild Adventurer>It seems like Dalton hired a lot of people. 
It's going to be difficult to track all of them.;\n<Guild Adventurer>Irina's become a little nicer recently.
To think the tyrant would suddenly become kinder like that.
I think I see her differently now... ;EV012;\n<Guild Staff>Ms. Irina and Mr. Dalton seem to be having a stand-off.
The problem seems to be that Mr. Dalton won't support 
the Guild and the adventurers are caging him in.;\n<Guild Staff>To think Dalton had a hand in those crimes. 
You really can't judge a person by their looks.;\n<Guild Staff>Even though we caught Dalton, we still
have to search for his accompices... 
I guess I'm not going home today either.;EV013;\n<Guild Adventurer>Wait, aren't you Blazing Haired Makina?
No way! I can't believe I'm meeting someone famous here!;\n<Guild Adventurer>(But seriously, her tits are huge! 
Just once, just once I'd love to 
play around with tits that big.);EV014;\n<Guild Staff>We've had a number of reports recently of female 
adventurers going missing recently. The Guild is 
investigating, but we haven't found any answers yet.;\n<Guild Staff>There are quite a lot missing female adventurers. 
I wonder if it's related to the underground market?;\n<Guild Staff>So the missing adventurers were Dalton's doing. 
We can't let him get away with what he did to those women. 
He must pay for his crimes.;\n<Guild Staff>Looks like all the adventures were safely rescued. 
Thank goodness we made it on time...;イリーナ;\n<Irina>I'll let you know when I need your assistance. Until then,
feel free to explore the ruins to your hearts content.;\n<Irina>Infiltrate the underground market, and find evidence 
linking Dalton with the illegal trade there. 
I'm counting on you.;\n<Irina>When you find absolute proof, report back to me.;\n<Makina>Irina, I found proof of Dalton's crimes.;\n<Irina>Really!? As expected from Blazing Haired Makina. 
Can I see it?;\n<Makina>First, there's this. A written contract with Dalton's 
signature, along with some other documents.;\n<Irina>Let's see... ;\n<Irina>I see... we can prove his crimes with these documents. 
Thank you, Makina.;\n<Irina>I can't believe you collected all these documents 
in such a short time. I'm impressed. The difference 
between you and that idiot who worked for me is vast.;\n<Makina>Haha... I'm glad to hear you're happy with that... ;\n<Makina>But that's not the only evidence I found... ;\n<Irina>You have more to show me?;\n<Makina>Regarding the missing adventurers... 
It was the work of Dalton. 
He's been holding them in a dungeon in his 
basement, in order to have his way with them.;\n<Makina>He'd rape them using things like tentacles, 
and sell drugged adventures to nobles.;\n<Irina>... ;\n<Makina>It made me sick just seeing it... ;\n<Irina>That bastard... to think he's been doing something so 
disgusting. If only I had suspected him sooner... ;\n<Makina>There's still time to save them, 
but we'll have to hurry.;\n<Irina>Is there a reason?;\n<Makina>I heard it from some men down there, but apparently 
they're going to be transporting the adventurers soon, 
so we have to rescue them before they do.;\n<Irina>...It appears time is of the essence.;\n<Irina>I understand. I'll make the preparations immediately. 
Tomorrow, we'll storm Dalton's residence. 
Can I count on your support?;\n<Makina>Of course. I've come this far, 
you couldn't stop me even if you tried.;\n<Irina>Fufu, I had a feeling you'd say that.;\n<Irina>Alright, come back here tomorrow when you're ready.;\n<Makina>Got it. Let's give Dalton a surprise he'll never forget.;\n<Irina>Indeed. Today will be his last day of freedom.;\n<Irina>You're here. I've finished my preparations. 
Are you ready to go?;\n<Makina>Yup. I'm ready.;\n<Makina>Speaking of which, regarding today's plan. 
I've spoken with Celia about it.;\n<Irina>You mean Celia of the Royal Knights?;\n<Makina>That's her. She said she'd lend us a hand. 
She should be here any moment.;\n<Irina>Huh, I didn't know you knew each other. 
But I'd be more than happy to have her help, 
since I know I can rely on her.;\n<Celia>Sorry to have kept you waiting.;\n<Irina>No, don't worry about it. Rather, thank you for
coming. It's reassuring to have the aid of a Royal Knight.;\n<Celia>Dalton's actions are absolutely unforgivable. 
It is my duty as a Knight to end his misdeeds.;\n<Makina>Time to make him pay.;\n<Irina>Agreed, let's get started.;\n<Irina>Let's go over the plan. First, when we arrive at 
Dalton's residence, guild personnel will surround 
the house. After that, us three along with a 
small group will rush in.;\n<Irina>The guild members and I will go capture Dalton, while
you two will head to the dungeon in the basement.;\n<Irina>Once both objectives have been completed, the remaining 
guild members will come in and seize the residence.;\n<Makina>So we head to the dungeon, leave it to us.;\n<Celia>Understood.;\n<Irina>If you meet resistance, you're authorized to use 
any force necessary. Your main objective is 
the rescue of the captured adventurers.;\n<Makina>Got it. Shall we get going?;\n<Irina>Do you need to do something? 
That's fine, but please make it quick.;\n<Makina>(Ah, that's right, I haven't told 
Celia about today's plan yet.);\n<Makina>Sorry Irina, but could you wait a little bit?;\n<Irina>If there really is someone who can turn people into monsters, 
then we have to do something about them.;\n<Makina>Irina, do you have a moment?;\n<Irina>Oh, Makina, what can I do for you?;\n<Makina>I have something I wanted to report to you... 
It's regarding that guy, Allos, that used to work here.;\n<Irina>That's a name I didn't really want to hear again... ;\n<Makina>You still haven't forgiven him...?;\n<Irina>Considering what he did, of course not.;\n<Irina>Anyways, what about him?;\n<Makina>Just a bit ago, it looked like he was peeking in 
through a guild house window. When I called out to him, 
he left right away.;\n<Irina>Peeking?;\n<Makina>Yeah... I thought it was a little suspicious, 
so I thought I'd let you know.;\n<Irina>I see... ;\n<Irina>Dammmit, what the hell is he up to!?;Irina's brow furrows.;\n<Makina>Well, that's all I wanted to report... ;\n<Irina>Fuh... 
I don't know what to make of this.;\n<Makina>Sorry to trouble you with my paranoia.;\n<Irina>It's no trouble at all.;\n<Makina>Well, I'm going to get going... ;\n<Irina>Okay, see you later.;Do you want to view Irina's scene?
(It will be added to your recollections regardless.);\n<Irina>I've been feeling a little off recently... ;\n<Makina>Are you okay? 
Maybe you've been overworking yourself... ;\n<Irina>That could be it. Maybe I'll call 
it early today, and go rest.;\n<Makina>That's a good idea. It'd be bad if 
you collapsed from exhaustion.;\n<Irina>Thanks for worrying about me, Makina.;\n<Makina>Don't worry about it, you're watching out for me too.;\n<Irina>Ugh... it's not just the follow up on the Dalton case, 
but there's also the cleanup of the underground market, 
and I'm having trouble concentrating... ;\n<Makina>Irina seems to be in a bad mood. 
Maybe I should leave her be... ;\n<Makina>Irina.;\n<Makina>Irina? 
What's wrong?;\n<Irina>Huh!? 
Uh, oh... Makina, I'm sorry. I was spacing out there.;\n<Makina>Are you okay? 
You're not overworking yourself again, are you?;\n<Irina>No, I'm getting plenty of rest. 
I'm actually feeling fine. 
I'm just thinking about what's going to happen soon.;\n<Makina>What's going to happen soon?;\n<Irina>Yeah, it's something that I'm looking forward to... ;\n<Makina>Wow, that's unusual. 
Seeing you make that kind of face.;\n<Irina>Sure, why not?;\n<Makina>Now I'm curious what it is... ;\n<Irina>It's a secret.;\n<Makina>That just makes me even more curious!;\n<Irina>Hey, I'm allowed to have a secret or two. 
Now stop prying, or I'll make you regret it.;\n<Makina>(Irina has seemed more relaxed lately... 
Maybe it's because the Dalton case is over.);\n<Makina>Hey, Irina.;\n<Irina>What's up?;\n<Makina>About what you said before, what was 
the thing you were looking forward to?;\n<Irina>Hmm... 
I guess you could say it was something to relieve stress.;\n<Makina>I see... ;\n<Makina>(In other words, she's not going to tell me...);\n<Irina>Fufu... \I[90];EV016;\n<Makina>Is this the Adventurer's Guild?
I'd like to get permission to go into the ruins.
Can I do that here?;\n<Guild Receptionist>Welcome, you're a new adventurer here correct?
If you would like to explore the ruins, 
you will need a permit from us.;\n<Makina>What do I need to do to get one?;\n<Guild Receptionist>To receive a permit, you will need to have an interview
with the guild leader Ms. Irina.;\n<Makina>An interview, huh... I'm not great with those.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Please do your best.;\n<Makina>About this guild leader, Irina, she doesn't seem to
have a very good reputation amongst the adventurers here. 
Seems like she's a bit harsh.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Hmmm, that may be so, but Ms. Irina is a good person.;\n<Guild Receptionist>She's taken charge of this city until the country 
finally gets involved, and she's helping minimize the 
damage from the bandits in the ruins.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Although, recently they've started targeting the town more, 
which is why Ms. Irina has started to try and recruit more 
people to help out.;\n<Makina>Sounds like things are getting rough. Well, 
I guess I'll play along.;\n<Guild Receptionist>Thank you very much.
Ms. Irina's office is right over there.;\n<Makina>Got it, thanks.;アロス;EV018;\n<???>Don't fuck with me!!;\n<Makina>W-what the!?;\n<Yelling Woman>Allos! This report is completely wrong!
What kind of lazy ass work is this!?;\n<Man Called Allos>M-my apologies, Ms. Irina.;\n<Irina>I don't need your damned apologies!;\n<Allos>It should have been correct, but the magical energy from 
the ruins must have distorted the data a bit.;\n<Irina>A bit? This is on an entirely different level!
If I'd sent a team in to investigate using this 
data it would've been a disaster!;\n<Allos>I-I'm sorry... ;\n<Irina>Again! How many times do I have to say I don't 
need your damned apologies!;\n<Makina>Th-that must be the guild leader Irina... ;\n<Makina>She certainly seems strong... 
Seeing her angry is even making me tremble... 
She's scary.;\n<Irina>Fine, whatever! Get the hell out.;\n<Allos>Y-yes. Excuse me... ;\n<Allos>Um... please excuse me.;\n<Makina>A-alright, here goes... ;\n<Makina>You're Irina, right? 
I'd like to get a permit to enter the ruins.;\n<Irina>Hahh, another adventurer... 
You don't seem that strong, wish you'd all just move on.;\n<Makina>Why are you trying to make it like 
this is such a pain in the ass?;\n<Irina>Yeah yeah, it was just a joke.
So, what's your name?;\n<Makina>It's Makina.;\n<Irina>...!
You don't mean you're THE Blazing Haired Makina?;\n<Makina>That's right.;\n<Irina>Oh? I wouldn't have expected to meet a 
famous adventurer like you here.;\n<Irina>I guess word of these ruins has 
spread pretty far already.;\n<Irina>Still though, Blazing Haired Makina... ;\n<Makina>Well? Are you going to give me a permit?;\n<Irina>Hmmm... ;\n<Irina>Alright, I'll issue you a permit.;\n<Makina>Really? Just like that?;\n<Irina>Yes. There's no reason to refuse someone of your caliber.;\n<Makina>Feels like you're leaving something out.;\n<Irina>In return, you'll have to agree to a condition. 
As long as you agree to that, I'll give you a permit.
Then you'll be free to explore the ruins as you see fit.;\n<Makina>I figured it would come to this.
So, what kind of condition are we talking about?;\n<Irina>Something big is going to be happening soon.
And as we're a bit short on combat power, I'd like your help.;\n<Makina>What exactly is going to be happening?;That I can't say. I can explain more once the time is right.
But for now, I can't tell you any more than I already have.
Well?;\n<Makina>(It's a bit much, but I do need a permit...);\n<Makina>Alright, I'll go along with your condition.;\n<Irina>As expected of Blazing Haired Makina.
You didn't hesitate at all.;\n<Makina>Well, now that I've agreed, you'll issue me a permit, right?;\n<Irina>Of course. Please sign here.;hide_treasure_popup;show_treasure_popup;Received a permit.;\n<Makina>Thanks.;\n<Irina>Of course. I look forward to working with you from now on.;\n<Makina>Same goes to you.;\n<Irina>Allos! I'm not letting you off with just a warning this time!;\n<Allos>I understand, I'm sorry.;\n<Irina>Do you realize that because of your actions, 
your companions almost died!?;\n<Allos>Y-yes... ;\n<Irina>That's why I'm having you resign.;\n<Allos>H-hold on! I'll do whatever it takes to make up for 
what happened, but please, don't fire me!;\n<Irina>No, no more excuses. It's not just this incident. 
Your abilities have been subpar the entire time 
you've been here. That's why you no longer have 
a place here.;\n<Allos>I-I'm begging you! The Guild is my life! 
I'll redouble my efforts, so please, don't fire me!;\n<Irina>It's too late. Pack up your belongings and leave. 
You're dismissed.;\n<Allos>E-excuse me... ;\n<Makina>Are you sure about firing him like that?;\n<Irina>It's fine. Anyways, it's none of your concern.;\n<Makina>Well, I guess you're right.;\n<Makina>So, did you have something you needed?;\n<Irina>Yes. Do you remember our conversation during the interview? 
The one about me wanting to move forward with a plan?;\n<Makina>The one you wanted me to help you with?;\n<Irina>That's the one. Our preparations are coming along, 
so I'd like you to participate.;\n<Makina>So? What kind of operation is it?;\n<Irina>Makina, have you heard any rumors about 
what's under this city?;\n<Makina>"Under?" You don't mean the ruins?;\n<Irina>No, not the ruins. 
Under the city of Gardona, lies another city of sorts.;\n<Makina>What the hell? 
I haven't heard anything about a place like that.;\n<Irina>To be honest, we didn't learn about it until a few months ago. 
Who would have thought there'd be another city.;\n<Makina>To be able to build something that large scale without 
everyone noticing... who could have done it?;\n<Irina>Dalton.;\n<Makina>Dalton? You mean that rich guy here in the city?;\n<Irina>That's the one. He started off as an ordinary trader here. 
But he suddenly started making large scale investments. 
Now his investments rival that of traders in the capital.;\n<Makina>But, what for?;\n<Irina>To make even more money of course. That and to gain 
political power. He plans on using this city to gain 
a foothold in the capital.;\n<Irina>And from there, he'll get even richer. He hasn't 
been able to compete in the normal market, so he's taken 
his business underground. Murder, brothels, casinos, drugs... 
You name it.;\n<Makina>I see. 
So I take it your plan is to uncover his crimes?;\n<Irina>Exactly. That's exactly what we're working towards.;\n<Makina>So that means there's something you want me to do?;\n<Irina>Precisely. I want you to infiltrate the underground market, 
and find evidence linking Dalton to the illegal trade there.;\n<Makina>What the hell is that!? 
You don't want me helping, you want me to do the whole thing!;\n<Irina>I'm sorry, but I can't rely on anyone but you. 
If the Guild makes any sudden movements, we'll be discovered. 
You won't stand out as much since you're new here, 
and you can hold your own in a pinch, right?;\n<Makina>Tsk, you were planning to use me from the start.;\n<Irina>Yeah, pretty much.;\n<Makina>Hahh... Well, that's fine I guess. 
Maybe doing a little recon work will fire me up.;\n<Irina>I was hoping you'd say that.;\n<Irina>Then I leave the rest to you. 
Go and find me some undeniable evidence.;\n<Makina>Got it.;The door is locked.;\n<Makina>Hm? That's rare. 
Irina's not here... ;\n<Makina>Well, I didn't really need anything, so oh well... ;EV019;\n<Allos>Hahh, why is she always so mad at me?;セリア;EV021;\n<Irina>Thanks to your help, we were able to stop Dalton's crimes. 
Thank you.;\n<Makina>Don't mention it. 
Although, it's frustrating we couldn't have captured 
him alive.;\n<Irina>Yeah, it's going to make tracking his crimes more difficult, 
and we still have to deal with the underground market.;\n<Irina>Hahh... There's still a long road ahead of us.;\n<Makina>Fufu, it's not like you to heave a sigh like that.;\n<Irina>You're right, especially when there's still so much to do... ;\n<Irina>So what are you going to do now, Makina?;\n<Makina>I think for now I'm going to continue exploring the ruins. 
After that, I want to look into how Dalton was 
transformed into a monster.;\n<Irina>What was up with that?;\n<Makina>I'm not sure, but from what the researcher told me, 
that monster was created from unnatural means.;\n<Irina>Unnatural... 
Are you saying someone turned Dalton into that monster?;\n<Makina>Probably. While exploring the ruins, I've come across other 
monsters like that, but this was before I was aware of 
Dalton's crimes. But if Dalton was turned into a monster 
like that, then that means... ;\n<Irina>That means there's someone out there turning 
people into monsters?;\n<Makina>That's what I'm thinking.;\n<Irina>Hm... ;\n<Irina>This sounds like a matter for the guild to look into. 
If someone like this is out there, then 
they're more dangerous than Dalton.;\n<Makina>Alright, then if I learn anything, I'll let you know.;\n<Irina>Sounds good, that will help a lot. 
But be careful out there, Makina.;\n<Makina>I will. Later.
