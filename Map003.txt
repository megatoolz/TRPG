You've come to search the ruins too, right?;\n<Makina>I am.  And?;\n<Young Adventurer>You'll want to head to the guild house.
The city's currently being governed by the Adventurer's Guild.;\n<Young Adventurer>And if you want to search the ruins, 
you'll need to get a permit from the guild.;\n<Makina>You don't say.;\n<Young Adventurer>However, the guild leader is a bit of a pain. 
If you don't meet their standards, you won't 
get a permit, so prepare yourself.;\n<Young Adventurer>By the way, the guild house is in the north part of the city. 
And if you need it afterwards, the bar is over there.;\n<Makina>Thanks for the help.;\n<Young Adventurer>Hehe. No problem.;\n<Makina>I could head to the guild house, but maybe I should have
a look around town before heading to the ruins.;EV071;\n<Lively Man>Whew, worked up a good sweat.;\n<Lively Man>Huh? Underground Market? Notes? 
What are you talking about?;\n<Makina>Looks like it's not him... ;\n<Lively Man>I'd like to check out the ruins a bit.;EV072;\n<Man Obsessed with Training>Fu, fu, haaaaaa!!;\n<Makina>Hey, I heard I have to talk to you about getting into the 
underground market.;\n<Man>... ;\n<Man>Who told you that?;\n<Makina>A drunk guy that was almost passed out.;\n<Man>Hmmm. You ain't with the guild.
Well, if you got the notes you can go, but lemme ask you something.;\n<Man>What do ya need from the underground market?;I want to work at the brothel;I want to fight in the arena;I'm looking to get some drugs;I just want to check it out;\n<Man>That so? Well, there's plenty of work for someone like you...;\n<Man>You seem pretty confident in your abilities.;\n<Man>Dumbass don't talk about that out here. But that's a good reason.;\n<Man>Ain't gonna let you in for that shitty reason.;\n<Man>Another question. You know how to get to the underground market?;\n<Makina>I heard you have to go down some stairs.;\n<Man>Right, seems like you really do want to get in.;\n<Man>Last question. How do you get to the stairs to go down?;Through the ruins;A secret house;I don't know;\n<Man>Well then I can't help you.;\n<Man>That so. Good, you shouldn't know.
Nobody's supposed to tell you about the stairs down there.;\n<Man>Only the one handling the notes is allowed to tell you.;\n<Man>Right, I'll give you your note. Here.;\n<Makina>Nice. So, how do I get there?;\n<Man>The warehouse next to the shitty inn. Show the guy there your note
and he'll let you down.;\n<Makina>I see.;\n<Man>There are no rules down in the underground market.
So you'd better be on guard.;\n<Makina>Who knows. Just clue me in.;\n<Man>Can't help you. If you really want 
to go then you'd better be willing to talk.;\n<Man Obsessed with Training>The entrance to the underground market is in the warehouse 
next to the cheap inn. Don't tell anyone else about it.;\n<Man Obsessed with Training>Dalton's the one that had us start using those damn notes.
I'm just gonna keep on training my body.;案内;\n<Young Adventurer>Yo! It's you again.;\n<Young Adventurer>If you need some help, check out the guild or the bar. 
You can learn a lot in those places!;\n<Young Adventurer>Hm? The rumor of the underground city?;\n<Young Adventurer>Yeah, I've heard about it. But I'd prefer to avoid getting 
mixed up in that dangerous talk. So yeah, I've got nothing 
for you on that topic.;\n<Young Adventurer>You're the one that took down 
Dalton, right? Not bad!;\n<Young Adventurer>I'm proud of you!;EV074;\n<Loud-mouthed Merchant>The richest person in town is Mr. Dalton. 
He was the first to find the ruins and 
struck it rich right away.;\n<Loud-mouthed Merchant>Now I'm going to set up shop here.;\n<Loud-mouthed Merchant>The richest person in town is Mr. Dalton. 
He was the first to find the ruins and 
become succesful right away.;\n<Loud-mouthed Merchant>An underground city? 
Haven't heard about it.;\n<Loud-mouthed Merchant>So Dalton only got where he was thanks to those 
underhanded things... but I'm different. 
I'll become an amazing merchant with my own power!;EV075;\n<Pretty Merchant>I have cheap potions! 
Or do you want an antidote?;\n<Pretty Merchant>Welcome. 5 potions for 400G. 
How about it?;Buy;Don't Buy;\n<Pretty Merchant>Thank you for your purchase.;400G was exchanged for 5 potions.;\n<Pretty Merchant>Thank you very much. Please come by again.;\n<Pretty Merchant>I'm sorry but you don't have enough money.;\n<Pretty Merchant>I see. Please come again.;EV076;\n<Energetic Showgirl>Welcome to Gardona!
Please feel free to take a look at my shop!!;チャラい冒険者;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Hey, if you're thinking of where 
to stay, you can come to my tent.♪ 
I can teach you all about the town and ruins.;\n<Twin-tailed Adventurer>Uhhh, that sounds pretty sketchy.
Sorry, I'm staying at the inn.;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Hey hey, how about today?
Come by my tent, I guarantee you won't regret it.;\n<Twin-tailed Adventurer>Haaaa, fine.
I'll go with you tonight.;\n<Twin-tailed Adventurer>But if you suck I'll leave.♪;\n<Twin-tailed Adventurer>Hehe, OK, OK.♪
Let's hurry up then.;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Man, that was the best.♪
If you ever want another go just let me know.;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Haaaaa... Man, it's tough 
dealing with girls that always have their guard up.;\n<Makina>Well then, how about keeping me company?;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Seriously!?
I'm just saying I ain't got any money.;\n<Makina>Who said anything about money?;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Hehe, I've been waiting for 
a woman like you... ;\fiSlap Slap Slap\fi;\n<Makina>Ahh, mmmm, oooh... 
Doing it out here during the day... \I[90]
Oooh, mmmmh, ahhh, AHHH!;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Damn, this feels too damn good,
Can't stop my hips... ;\n<Makina>Mmmm, ahhhh, oh god... \I[90];\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Hey, look over the wall there,
That girl, she might be able to see us right?;\n<Makina>Huh...?;\n<Makina>W-wait a sec, hold on!!;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Damn, you just started tightening
up! Shit, too tight!;\n<Makina>No way, hold on she'll see us.;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Fuck, cumming.;\n<Makina>Ahhh, shit. No good, cumming... CUMMING!\I[90];Spurt, spurt, spurt.;\n<Makina>Ahhhhhhh... amazing... ;\n<Flirtatious Adventurer>Doing it outside is great♪.
Lemme know if you want another go.;\n<Makina>If I feel like it... \I[90];EV078;\n<Twin-tailed Adventurer>Uhhh, that sounds pretty sketchy. 
Sorry, I'm staying at the inn.;\n<Twin-tailed Adventurer>Haahh, fine.
I'll go with you tonight.;EV079;\n<White-bearded Adventurer>Anyways, that damned bitch of a guild leader keeps 
saying that she's in charge and holding us back. ;\n<Slit-eyed Adventurer>I know! It's pissing me off. It's not like her damn authority 
here is worth anything. I'm getting sick of it. Maybe that 
nice body of hers needs to get a little punishment.♪;\n<White-bearded Adventurer>Hehehe... that'd be nice. 
Wish I could see her stupid face when I take her from
behind and see if she could still act so high and mighty.;\n<White-bearded Adventurer>Seems like Irina's been 
getting a bit softer as of late.;\n<Slit-eyed Adventurer>It's gotta be cause of a guy, right?
Probably fucking her all night.;\n<White-bearded Adventurer>Only way to deal with a 
woman like that is to take it to her in bed.;\n<Slit-eyed Adventurer>Damn, I want to do her too now.;EV080;EV081;\n<Hunched Over Merchant>This city has become lively thanks to the rumors. 
My merchant's soul is all fired up, hohoho.;EV082;\n<Collapsed Adventurer>Ahhh-I'm beat. Gonna take a break.;EV083;\n<Daydreaming Woman>Ahhh\I[90], ahh\I[90], 
I can't get enough of this manly smell.;EV084;\n<Debonair Adventurer>Yo, this is the training grounds. 
Did you come to train?;\n<Debonair Adventurer>Yo, this is the training grounds.
Did you come to train?;\n<Debonair Adventurer>Hm? Underground city? 
What are you on about?;EV085;\n<Indignant Adventurer>Damnit, I've got no permit so 
I can't get into the ruins.
I won't forgive you Irina... One day, I'll get you.;\n<Indignant Adventurer>Damnit, the Guild has gotten 
worse since they took out Dalton. Bastard should 
have dealt with Irina before he got offed.;\n<Indignant Adventurer>It's weird, I hated Irina so much, 
but it's all gone now. I feel strangely refreshed now 
that I'm not so angry. I wonder what happened?;EV086;\n<Boy Running in Circles>Uoooo, I'm gonna sprint 
at full power!!;EV087;\n<Boy Running Around>Uoooooooooo, I'm not gonna lose!!
I'm gonna go up another gear!!;EV088;\n<Watching Woman>There are some cursed adventurers in this city.
The sisters from the Church have taken them in
since they can no longer work.;EV089;\n<Adventurer Remembering a Friend>Damn, you had to go and die before me. 
But rest easy, I'll definitely get 
the treasure from the ruins.;EV090;\n<Cat>Meow.;EV091;\n<Head-tilting Adventurer>That's strange... I'd heard that there was a brothel 
and an arena in this city... ;\n<Head-tilting Adventurer>If they're not in this part of town, 
then where are they?;\n<Head-tilting Adventurer>An underground market? 
There's a place like that here? I'll bet that's where 
the brothel and arena are!;\n<Pleased Adventurer>I finally found the underground market. 
It's got a brothel and an arena, it's seriously great.;\n<Pleased Adventurer>But thanks to the whole Dalton thing it looks like 
the Arena's closed.;酔っぱらい;\n<Drunk Treasure Hunter>Ahhh I drank too much.
But man, it's great down there... the drinks are amazing.;\n<Makina>...?;\n<Makina>Hey you, know anything about the underground city?;\n<Drunk>Huh? Course I know bout it.;\n<Drunk>It's great there. Both the drinks and the brothel are amazing. 
It's like heaven compared to this cramped shit hole.;\n<Makina>So how do you get there?;\n<Drunk>I ain't gonna tell ya that easy like.;\n<Makina>How much do you want?;\n<Drunk>Hmmm. Well I need some more to hit the bar up again... 
How about 900 gold.;Pay;Don't Pay;\n<Drunk>Hehe, thanks.;\n<Makina>So, how do I get there?;\n<Drunk>Well it still won't be easy. To get down there 
you'll need a promissory note from someone else.;\n<Makina>A promissory note... Where do I get one of those?;\n<Drunk>Look for a skinhead. He's the one dealing with them. 
You can probably find him at the training grounds.;\n<Makina>Guess I'll head over there then.;\n<Drunk>Sure.;\n<Drunk>Hey, you ain't got enough.;\n<Drunk Treasure Hunter>You can get a promissory note from the skinhead. 
He's usually at the training grounds.;\n<Drunk Treasure Hunter>Even if everyone knew about the underground market 
nothing bad would happen. There's too many powerful 
people that love it.;EV093;\n<Guide Girl>This is the district with the Guild, Item Shop, 
and Weapon Shop.　There's also the Church 
and Mr. Dalton's Mansion.;\n<Guide Girl>The guild is currently investigating 
Dalton's mansion.;EV094;\n<Jealous Man>That mansion next to the church is 
Mr. Dalton's. He was the first to find the ruins and 
as a result has gotten filthy rich as the city has grown. 
I'm pretty damn jealous of him.;\n<Jealous Man>I knew Dalton was sketchy from the 
beginning. Man, If I'd just spoken up earlier I could 
have gotten a reward.;EV095;\n<Tall Female Adventurer>The weapon shop sells good gear
but the guy running it is a pervert. He had me strip and 
said he was taking measurements while grabbing me all over.;\n<Tall Female Adventurer>You should be careful around him.;\n<Tall Female Adventurer>I saw a female Knight with 
a broken sword enter the Blacksmiths shop earlier.;\n<Tall Female Adventurer>I'm sure she's hoping to 
fix her sword but... 
That old Canton is sure to ask her to do something weird... ;\n<Tall Female Adventurer>Recently I've been hearing 
some lewd voices coming from Canton's shop. And they've 
started sounding a lot more primal too.;EV096;\n<Wandering Minstrel>I've finally arrived in Gardona, the City of Ruins.~♪
The city where adventurers gather to seek out their fortune.~♪
Will their desires lead to their success or their ruin?~♪;\n<Wandering Minstrel>Everyone in the city respected the great millionaire.~♪
But they didn't know who he really was.~♪
The unendingly wicked man known as Dalton.~♪;\n<Wandering Minstrel>His wickedness was uncovered though.~♪
But he was captured by one who's now the savior of the city.~♪
And that wonderful adventurer is none other than Makina.~♪;EV097;\n<Stout Farmer>This is the Farmer's District. Because Adventurers 
have such big appetites, we make quite a penny.;\n<Stout Farmer>Mr. Dalton was a good guest and all but... 
Oh well, such is life.;EV098;\n<Commentary Girl>You can find items in barrels and pots.
You should search the entire area.;EV099;\n<Farmer's Wife>One of those young adventurers spoke with me earlier.\I[90] 
And with how he was staring, it was obvious that he was 
interested.;\n<Farmer's Friend>How nice.~\I[90] 
My husband doesn't pay attention to me anymore. 
It's starting to get frustrating.
Why don't we try going to the bar tonight?\I[90];\n<Farmer's Wife>Oh come on.♪ Though it could be pretty exciting. 
But just once might be fine. Too bad for my husband.\I[90];\n<Farmer's Wife>Hey hey, so what happened with him yesterday? 
That young guy at the bar you were drinking 
and kept hitting on you.;\n<Farmer's Friend>Well, he pushed me down once we got to his tent, 
and then he started kissing me and sweet-talking 
and begging to do it over and over again.♪;\n<Farmer's Friend>So I went with the flow and before longwe were having sex. 
I tell you, his dick just wouldn't quit no matter how much we 
did it. The whole time he was telling me to become his 
woman too.;\n<Farmer's Wife>Woah, that's crazy. Young guys sure are different.;\n<Farmer's Friend>So what about you? You had that older 
guy that was all over you, right?;\n<Farmer's Wife>Hmmmm, I don't know if I should say.~\I[90];\n<Farmer's Friend>Hey, don't clam up on me now! Spit it out!;\n<Farmer's Wife>Hey, why don't we try going to the underground market? 
I'll bet there's tons of good guys there.;\n<Farmer's Friend>My god, you just can't get enough of guys now. 
What are you going to do if your husband catches you?;\n<Farmer's Wife>You say that, but you really want to go too, don't you? 
You came back super late last night after all.;\n<Farmer's Friend>Hahaha, you saw that?
Well, I guess we could check it out... ;EV100;\n<Farmer's Friend>Hey, don't clam up on me now!
Spit it out!;EV101;\n<Old Carpenter>With all these adventurers showing up,I can't keep 
up with demand. We've started putting them in tents, 
but if this keeps up, we're going to have problems 
with both the smell and hygiene.;\n<Old Carpenter>Building a city underground is just asking for problems. 
I mean, think of how plague would spread due to all of 
the sewage.;EV102;\n<Dog>Woof, woof!;EV103;\n<Cheerful Grandma>Ahh, good weather again.;EV104;\n<Old Farmer>Our farm was destroyed and the crops were stolen. 
But it wasn't humans, it looks like the works of demons... 
This is bad.;\n<Old Farmer>My crops have been getting ruined lately.
I'm pretty sure it's the work of a goblin.;\n<Old Farmer>Well, it only seems to be a lone stray 
so the damage hasn't been too bad so far. 
It's still a problem though.;\n<Makina>A stray goblin you say? I wonder if it's
the one down there... ;\n<Old Farmer>You wouldn't happen to know anything
about it, would you?;\n<Makina>Yeah, I found a stray goblins house 
down in the ruins.;\n<Old Farmer>Ooh, could you maybe deal with him for me then? 
You don't have to kill him, just tell him to 
stop stealing my vegetables.;\n<Makina>I guess I could. Just make sure you have 
a reward waiting for me.;\n<Old Farmer>Of course. So long as the damage stops 
I'll reward you. So I'm counting on you now!;\n<Makina>Let's see, the stray goblins house was on 
floor B14 of the underground ruins.;\n<Old Farmer>I'm relying on you for that goblin.;\n<Old Farmer>Hey, how'd it go with that stray goblin?;\n<Makina>That's... it didn't go well... ;\n<Old Farmer>I see, he must be pretty strong then.;\n<Old Farmer>So, what about my request?
I'd like it if you could give it another go.;\n<Makina>Well... ;Go one more time;Don't go;\n<Old Farmer>Ohhh, you will!? Please give it another shot.
I'm counting on you.;\n<Makina>(Well, I'll give it one more try... ;\n<Old Farmer>Oh, I see... ;\n<Old Farmer>Well, if you change your mind let me know. 
I don't think I could rely on any of the 
other adventurers around here.;\n<Old Farmer>Oh it's you.
Are you going to try and deal with the goblin again?;\n<Old Farmer>Ohhh, you will!? Please give it 
another shot. I'm counting on you.;\n<Old Farmer>I'm relying on you for that stray goblin.;\n<Old Farmer>You're back... 
How'd it go this time?;\n<Makina>Okay I guess, but not that well either... ;\n<Old Farmer>Is that so... ;\n<Old Farmer>Well, not much to be done about it then... 
He's probably desparate to survive as is.;\n<Old Farmer>Hmmmm, let's see.
I want to try and put an end to this stuff with the goblin.
I'll have to think of what to do with my field now.;\n<Makina>Sorry, even though you asked for my help... ;\n<Old Farmer>Aw don't worry about it.
Looks like I just caused you problems.
Have this for your troubles.;Received an Elixir.;\n<Makina>What? No I can't take this, 
I didn't do anything... ;\n<Old Farmer>Don't worry about it, you did your best.
You'll need it on your adventurers.;\n<Old Farmer>Take care lassy.;\n<Makina>Yeah... ;\n<Makina>(I guess with this I don't need to go to 
that goblin anymore... ;\n<Old Farmer>I'll figure out some way to deal 
with that goblin.;EV105;\n<Farmer's Boy>I was playing around earlier, and an old adventurer 
told me he'd teach me something good if I came into 
his tent. What kind of thing do you think he meant?;EV106;\n<Pleasant Swordsman>To go to the ruins in the city, 
you have to get a pass from the guild.;\n<Pleasant Swordsman>But to get one you have to have 
an interview with the Guild Leader, Irina. She's not called
the Iron Lady for nothing though. It's very difficult
to get her approval.;\n<Pleasant Swordsman>That's why even though it's what they
came here for, many adventurers can't actually
explore the ruins. So now, a bunch of
them are frustrated with her.;EV107;\n<Guild Guard>The mission from the country is
supposed to be coming here soon. Seems like their 
investigation is going to be starting.;\n<Guild Guard>Wait, won't that take the guild's 
work away? What are we gonna do?;\n<Guild Guard>Thanks to the stuff with Dalton we've 
been getting a bunch of extra work. 
It's really wearing me out.;\n<Guild Guard>You wanna try and hit up the 
underground market to relax?;EV108;見物人;\n<Quiet Woman>I wonder how Mr. Dalton makes his money. 
Getting that rich just from investing in 
the city seems unlikely.;\n<Quiet Woman>I hope that now that Dalton's gone, that
the city will get a bit more peaceful.;\n<Quiet Woman>Oh, you were having sex with that guy earlier... ;\n<Makina>So you did see... ;\n<Quiet Woman>U-um... did it really feel that good?;\n<Makina>I guess so... \I[90];\n<Quiet Woman>I wish I could moan like that... ;EV110;\n<Pigtailed Adventurer>A lot of Adventurers have gone to Mr. Dalton
for help, but he seems pretty strict when it comes to 
repayment. I've also heard that people disappear
inside his place. Seems scary to me.;\n<Pig-tailed Adventurer>I'm glad the captive adventurers are fine. 
The guild is even being surprisingly diligent about 
all this. They're even conducting an investigation.;EV111;\n<Guild Guard>This is the Guild's dormitory.;衛兵１;\n<Guild Guard>Oh? Are you going to go to the ruins?
I used to be an adventurer like you,
then I took an arrow to the knee.;EV113;\n<Guild Guard>If you're going to the ruins, be careful.
It's not just monsters, there are bandits in there too.;EV114;\n<Guild Member>The Knight from the country was 
supposed to be coming to conduct an investigation but 
still hasn't arrived. I wonder if something happened.;\n<Guild Member>Celia showed up a bit ago with a 
flashy Knight. Fortunately she looked like she was fine.;\n<Guild Member>It looks like Celia's sword broke.
She'll probably need to go to the blacksmith to get it fixed.;\n<Guild Member>The operation is going to be starting soon.
I wonder if Celia is going to be able to help us out.;\n<Guild Member>Thanks for all your hard work.
Celia said she was going to talk to the monster researcher.;EV115;\n<Female Adventurer with Money Troubles>So this is Mr. Dalton's mansion.
I came to see if he would lend me some money, but there 
are strange rumors about him... What should I do?;\n<Female Adventurer with Money Troubles>Oh wow, I guess I was right not to borrow money here. 
I might have ended up getting sold too.;EV116;\n<White-haired Adventurer>I heard that one of the Royal Knights is coming to 
conduct an official investigation. It'd be nice 
if nothing troublesome came of it... ;\n<White-haired Adventurer>I heard that one of the King's knights is coming to do 
a legitimate investigation. It'd be nice if nothing 
troublesome came of it... ;\n<White-haired Adventurer>Underground city? I heard someone 
say it was under that cheap inn.;\n<White-haired Adventurer>With all the ruckus because of Dalton, 
the city might become even more famous. 
This could become quite troublesome... ;EV117;Found a Potion.;There's nothing inside.;EV118;EV119;EV120;EV121;EV122;You found a Potion.;EV123;Found a Potion;EV124;EV125;EV126;EV127;EV128;EV129;EV130;EV131;EV132;Found 200 Gold.;EV133;EV134;EV135;Found 250 Gold.;EV136;EV137;EV138;EV139;Found 70 Gold.;EV140;EV141;EV142;Found an Antidote.;EV143;\n<Searching Adventurer>Um, do you have a minute?;\n<Makina>What is it?;\n<Searching Adventurer>Three days ago, my adventurer 
friends went missing. There's no way they'd go to the 
ruins alone, so I think they may have been kidnapped.;\n<Makina>Sorry, I haven't.;\n<Searching Adventurer>I see... ;\n<Makina>I don't know if I can do anything... 
But if I see something I'll let you know.;\n<Searching Adventurer>Oh! Thank you very much.;\n<Makina>Hm? Weren't you the one searching for 
your missing friend? How's that worked out? Have 
you found them yet?;\n<Searching Adventurer>Oh you remembered that?
Um, my name is Millia.;\n<Millia>And about my friend, sadly I haven't 
found them yet.;\n<Makina>Sorry to hear that.;\n<Millia>But I did find a clue. A few weeks ago she 
was surrounded by a bunch of adventurers... ;\n<Millia>And apparently those adventurers work for 
Mr. Dalton. At least that's what I heard.;\n<Makina>Dalton's adventurers... ;\n<Millia>So I've been trying to find a way to get in
and have a word with Mr. Dalton.;\n<Makina>That Dalton guy is sounding more and more 
suspicious. Missing people... don't tell me he's 
involved in human trafficking?;\n<Millia>What?;\n<Makina>I know it's hard, but hold on for just a 
bit longer. I'm going to see if I can find something.;\n<Millia>Oh, absolutely! Thank you so much!
My friend's name is Sarya by the way.;\n<Millia>Oh Makina. Um, you wouldn't happen to have
learned anything about Sarya, have you?;EV144;Found an Ether.;EV145;EV146;\n<Guild Guard>Hold up there. Do you have a permit?;\n<Makina>A permit? Can't say that I do.;\n<Guild Guard>If you want to enter the ruins you need a permit. 
You can get one issued to you by the Guild.;\n<Makina>Got it.;\n<Guild Guard>You... have a permit. 
Alright then go ahead.;EV147;\n<Guild Guard>You... have a permit. Alright then go ahead.;EV148;\n<Makina>Right, first off I need to infiltrate the 
underground market.;\n<Makina>Guess I'll need to ask around to find 
out how to get down there.;\n<Makina>Oh yeah, I should tell Celia about tomorrow.
I can ask her to come along.;\n<Makina>Now where could she be right now... ;EV149;\n<Makina>Hmm, wonder if Celia is alright?;Do you want to view Celia's scene?
(It will be added to your recollections regardless.);EV150;EV151;EV152;EV153;\n<Millia>Oh! Makina!
You really did save Sarya, I can't thank you enough.;\n<Makina>I'm just glad she's safe now.;\n<Millia>Only thanks to you Makina. I know it's not 
much, but please take this for all you did.;\n<Millia>Sarya is only back thanks to you Makina.
Thank you so much.;EV154;\n<Sarya>Ummm, th-thank you so much... If you hadn't come 
when you did... I don't know what would have happened.;\n<Makina>I'm just glad I could save you.;\n<Sarya>Thank you!;EV155;\n<Makina>What to do now?;\n<Makina>I could check out the ruins or look 
around town for a bit.;アロス;EV157;\n<Makina>Huh? That guy over there,
that's the guy Irina fired. Allos I think it was?;\n<Makina>Hey, what are you doing?;\n<Allos>Huh? 
Oh, it's you, Makina.;\n<Allos>I'm not doing anything really.
I was just wondering how to deal with her... ;\n<Makina>Her?;\n<Allos>But it's no use, I'm going to go... ;\n<Makina>Does he want to get back into the guild?
Somehow I doubt that's it... ;\n<Makina>And besides the aura around him was 
definitely different from before... 
I should let Irina know about this.;EV158;\n<Makina>Whew, I was worried about that, but thankfully
it seems like Celia is going to be fine.;\n<Makina>Those tentacles were all over her 
so it couldn't be helped.;\n<Makina>But anyways, Celia was... 
Yeah that was pretty wild... ;EV159;EV160;EV161;EV162;EV163;EV164;EV165;EV166;\n<Makina>Those two seemed so normal this morning... ;EV167;\n<Makina>I really shouldn't have looked yesterday... ;EV168;EV169;\n<Celia>What is it, Makina?;About the orcs;About Canton;It's nothing;\n<Makina>I really thought we were dead when we
we got captured by those orcs.;\n<Celia>Haha, it certainly was dangerous.
I am sorry for getting you involved.;\n<Makina>I guess it's fine seeing as we got out.;\n<Celia>Well then, would you like to go again?;\n<Makina>HUH!?;\n<Celia>Haha, just a joke.;\n<Makina>(I wonder about that...);\n<Makina>So Celia... 
About Canton... ;\n<Celia>What about him?;\n<Makina>Well, I saw... 
I saw you two having anal sex.;\n<Celia>Wha-... ;\n<Makina>I didn't know what to say so
I thought I should just stay quiet... ;\n<Celia>I see... 
So that's what you were worried about... ;\n<Makina>I'm sorry Celia.;\n<Celia>No, there is nothing for you to apologize 
for Makina. It was all a result of my own actions.
Thank you for talking to me about it though.;\n<Makina>Sure... ;\n<Celia>But still... you saw it all... ;\n<Celia>Hmmm... ;\n<Celia>Well then, why don't you join me the next time
I go to visit Canton, Makina?;\n<Makina>Eh? W-what the hell are you saying!?;\n<Celia>Makina, if you are bringing it up like this, 
you are probably interested are you not? 
It excites you, doesn't it?;\n<Makina>T-there's no way... ;\n<Celia>It is fine if you are too embarassed right now.
You are free to do what you would like.;\n<Celia>Is that so, well if there is anything you 
would like to talk about feel free to come to me. 
I will help however I can.;EV170;EV171;There's a bath inside.
You shouldn't go in right now.;EV172;EV173
